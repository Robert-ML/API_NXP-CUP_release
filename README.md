# API_NXP-CUP_release
 For now it supports only the ARC Board.

 For best results, tune the PID loop for speed control by yourself.

 For every module, the pin configuration is in the "... peripherals configuration.txt" and the clock configuration is in image "... clock configuration.png".
 
 For a detailed explanation of the API, please refer to this [web-page](https://ocw.cs.pub.ro/courses/pm/prj2021/abasoc/api_arc_board).

 Help and sugestions are more than welcome to this project.
