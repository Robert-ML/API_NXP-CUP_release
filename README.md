# API_NXP-CUP_release
 For now it supports only the ARC Board.

 For best results, tune the PID loop for speed control by yourself.

 The clock configuration is in the image "clock configuration.png".

 For every module, the pin configuration is in the "... peripherals configuration.txt".
 
 For a detailed explanation of the API, please refer to this [web-page](https://ocw.cs.pub.ro/courses/pm/prj2021/abasoc/api_arc_board).

 Help and sugestions are more than welcome to this project.
